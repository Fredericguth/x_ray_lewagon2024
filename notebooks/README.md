## Data Notes
-----------------------
- Data is split into folders of types of factures containing all kinds of bones
- Each fracture folder is split into train and test folders

# Types of Fractures
------------
1. Avulsion fracture:
- This occurs when a fragment of bone is pulled away  tendon or ligament. It typically happens due to a strong muscle contraction or force applied to the bone

2. Comminuted fracture:
- A comminuted fracture involves the bone breaking into several pieces. This type of fracture is usually caused by severe trauma, such as a car accident.

3. Fracture Dislocation:
- This is a combination of a fracture and a dislocation, where the bone is not only broken but also displaced from its joint.

4. Greenstick Fracture:
- Commonly seen in children, a greenstick fracture occurs when the bone bends and cracks, but does not break completely. It is similar to how a green twig breaks.

5. Hairline Fracture:
- Also known as a stress fracture, a hairline fracture is a small, thin crack in the bone. It often occurs due to repetitive stress or overuse.

6. Impacted Fracture:
- This type of fracture happens when the broken ends of the bone are driven into each other. It can occur due to falls or accidents where a strong force compresses the bone.

7. Longitude Fracture:
- A longitudinal fracture runs along the length of the bone. It can be caused by direct or indirect force.

8. Oblique Fracture:
- An oblique fracture is characterized by an angled break across the bone. It is often caused by a sharp blow or indirect force applied at an angle.

9. Pathilogical Fracture:
- This type of fracture occurs in bones weakened by disease, such as osteoporosis, cancer, or infection. The bone can break with minimal or no trauma.

10. Spiral Fracture:
- A spiral fracture occurs when a rotating force is applied along the axis of the bone. It results in a helical break and is commonly seen in twisting injuries.
